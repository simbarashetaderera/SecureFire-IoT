# How to Set Up a Telegram Bot

This guide explains how to create and configure a Telegram Bot for use in IoT or automation projects (e.g., fire detection systems).  

## Step 1: Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open **Telegram** on your mobile device or desktop.  
2. Search for **BotFather** — it is the official Telegram bot for creating and managing other bots.  
3. Start a chat with BotFather and type:  /newbot
4. BotFather will ask for:  
- **Name** – this is your bot’s display name (e.g., 'Fire Detection Alert Bot')  
- **Username** – must end with 'bot' (e.g., 'FireDetection_Bot')  
5. After setup, BotFather will generate a **Bot Token**, which looks like this: '9238587890:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRstuVwxyZ'
**Save this token securely** — it will be used to connect your bot to your code.
> **Security Tip:** Never share your bot token publicly. If exposed, revoke and generate a new token in BotFather.
6. To get your Telegram user ID, search for **userinfobot** in Telegram.  
7. Start a chat and type: '/start'
8. UserInfoBot will display your **Telegram ID**, which you will use in your code to send or receive messages.  

## Step 2: Set Up Your Bot in Arduino IDE

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries…**  
3. Search for and install the following libraries:   
- 'UniversalTelegramBot'  
- 'WiFiClientSecure' 
4. You can now integrate the bot token and your Telegram ID into your IoT code to send or receive alerts automatically.

**Example Use Case:**  

Check the code  
Use this bot to receive instant alerts from your ESP8266-based fire detection system when smoke, gas, or flame is detected.
