#  How to Set Up a Telegram Bot

This guide explains how to create and configure a Telegram Bot for use in IoT or automation projects (e.g., fire detection systems).

## Step 1: Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open **Telegram** on your mobile device or desktop.  
2. Search for **BotFather** — it is the official Telegram bot for creating and managing other bots.  
3. Start a chat with BotFather and type:
/newbot

Copy code
4. BotFather will ask for:
- **Name** – this is your bot’s display name (e.g., `Fire Detection Alert Bot`)  
- **Username** – must end with `bot` (e.g., `FireDetection_Bot`)  
5. After setup, BotFather will generate a **Bot Token**, which looks like this:
9238587890:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRstuVwxyZ

Copy code
**Save this token securely** — it will be used to connect your bot to your code.  
6. To get your Telegram user ID, search for **userinfobot** in Telegram.  
7. Start a chat and type:
/start

Copy code
8. UserInfoBot will display your **Telegram ID**, which you’ll use in your code to send or receive messages.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Bot in Arduino IDE

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.  
2. Go to **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries…**  
3. Search for and install the following libraries:
- `UniversalTelegramBot`
- `WiFiClientSecure`  
4. You can now integrate the bot token and your Telegram ID into your IoT code to send or receive alerts automatically.

**Example Use Case:**
  Use this bot to receive instant alerts from your ESP8266-based fire detection system when smoke, gas, or flame is detected.
